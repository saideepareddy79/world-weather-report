Weather App is a sleek, responsive web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features a clean card-based UI with dynamic background effects, animated weather icons, and intuitive search functionality. It displays current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed, while handling invalid city inputs gracefully with error messages. Designed for simplicity and functionality, this project serves as a beginner-friendly example of integrating third-party APIs and enhancing user experience with modern web design principles.
